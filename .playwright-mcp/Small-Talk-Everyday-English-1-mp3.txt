[0:12] [SPEAKER_01] So, what's new Mark? How is your new job going?
[0:17] [SPEAKER_00] To be honest, I can't complain. I really love the company that I am working for.
[0:26] [SPEAKER_00] My co-workers are all really friendly and helpful. They really help me feel welcome.
[0:34] [SPEAKER_00] It's a really energetic and fun atmosphere. My boss is hilarious. And he's really flexible.
[0:44] [SPEAKER_00] Really? How so?
[0:47] [SPEAKER_00] He allows me to come in when I want and make my own hours.
[0:53] [SPEAKER_00] I can also leave early if I start early. There is no real dress code either.
[1:01] [SPEAKER_00] I can wear jeans and a t-shirt if I want. I can even wear shorts in the summer.
[1:09] [SPEAKER_01] Wow. It sounds really cool. I can't stand wearing a suit every day.
[1:16] [SPEAKER_01] Which do you prefer? Working late or finishing early?
[1:21] [SPEAKER_00] I prefer finishing early. I really enjoy the morning. I love getting up early and going for a run.
[1:31] [SPEAKER_00] There's nothing like watching the sunrise while drinking my morning coffee.
[1:37] [SPEAKER_01] Really? I am opposite. I love sleeping in. I am most alert in the evenings. I'm a real night owl.
[1:54] [SPEAKER_00] Well, you know what they say. The early bird catches the worm. You know, you could be right.
[2:03] [SPEAKER_01] Maybe I will try to go to bed a little earlier tonight.
