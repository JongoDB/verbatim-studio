# What is Verbatim Studio?

## Quick Answer
Verbatim Studio is a privacy-first application for transcribing audio and video files. All processing happens locally on your device - your data never leaves your computer.

## Key Concepts

### Local Processing
Unlike cloud-based transcription services, Verbatim Studio runs AI models directly on your machine. This means:
- Complete privacy - no data uploaded to external servers
- Works offline once models are downloaded
- No subscription fees for transcription

### Recordings
Audio and video files you upload for transcription. Supported formats include MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, and more.

### Transcripts
The text output from transcription, divided into timestamped segments. Each segment shows who spoke (if diarization is enabled) and when.

### Projects
Folders for organizing related recordings. For example, group all interviews for a research project together.

### Documents
PDFs and other documents you upload. Verbatim Studio can extract text using OCR and include them in AI chat context.

### AI Chat
An assistant that can analyze your transcripts and documents. Attach content and ask questions like "summarize the key points" or "what action items were mentioned?"
