# Searching Your Content

## Quick Answer
Use the Search page to find content across all recordings, transcripts, documents, and notes. Choose between keyword search (exact matches) or semantic search (meaning-based).

## Step-by-Step

1. Navigate to **Search** in the sidebar
2. Enter your search query
3. Press Enter or click Search
4. Results show:
   - **Recordings**: Matching titles and metadata
   - **Segments**: Transcript text with timestamps
   - **Documents**: Content with page numbers
   - **Notes**: Your annotations
5. Click any result to navigate to that location

## Search Modes

### Keyword Search
- Finds exact text matches
- Fast and precise
- Best for: specific phrases, names, technical terms

### Semantic Search
- Finds conceptually related content
- AI-powered meaning matching
- Best for: topics, themes, "what was discussed about X"

## UI Location
- **Page**: Search
- **Quick search**: Also available in header

## Tips
